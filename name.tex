We identified three dimensions to describe SCL applications, (i) SC, (ii) HCI, (iii) Learning.
Within each of the categories a list of features that describe applications for SCL:

SC
DATA
collection
visualization
processing
physical manipulation
multiple feedback
untethered 
easily embeddable

Data collection: intended and use of open datasets available from third parties or 


HCI
User interaction

sharing of artifacts and information
background/foreground
distributed interaction
multimodal 
sensor based interaction


Primitive
touch/tap
tilt
rotate
shake
vertical shift
led light feedback
haptic feedback
sound feedback


Learning
reflection
technology enhanced
game based
