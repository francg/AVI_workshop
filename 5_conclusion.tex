In this article we proposed a new way to empower technology in smart city learning scenarios. The limitations of current technological patterns were highlighted, then augmented objects and TUIs were introduced as a viable alternative to more traditional approaches.

Our claim is that the proposed guidelines can be combined and used to author and design SCL applications that empower augmented objects, IoT and TUIs.

Strengths and advantages of using smart objects and TUIs in connection to smart city learning issues were also presented.

Using this approach we believe it will be possible to successfully address several of the challenges that characterize research and interaction in smart city learning scenarios, but more research and feedback are needed to better ground the claims proposed.

CHALLENGES

The learning process can follow several approaches. Based on the specific domain, can be challenging to find the most effective.
