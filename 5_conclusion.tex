In this article we proposed a new way to empower technology in SCL scenarios. Starting from the literature, the limitations of current technological patterns were highlighted, then AOs and TUIs were introduced as a viable alternative to more traditional approaches. TILES is then proposed as a valuable toolkit for rapid prototyping with SOs.

Our claim is that the proposed primitives can be combined and used to author and design SCL applications that empower SOs, IoT and TUIs. Strengths and challenges of the authoring process were also presented.

Using this approach we believe it will be possible to successfully address several of the challenges that characterize research and interaction in SCL scenarios. More research and feedback are needed to better ground the claims proposed.
